Crypto Wallet is a React Native Expo app designed to connect with your MetaMask wallet, allowing you to view your crypto balance seamlessly. The app also offers functionality for tracking the prices of popular cryptocurrencies, complete with historical charts and detailed coin descriptions.

Crypto Wallet is a three-screen application featuring stack navigation, flatlists, and react-native-svg elements.

APIs and libraries utilized to accomplish this task:
1. CoinGecko API (https://www.coingecko.com/): Used for REST requests to retrieve coin data, including current prices, price history, images, ratings, and coin descriptions.
2. Wagmi (https://wagmi.sh/): Used to integrate MetaMask wallet sign-up within the app.
3. React-native-chart-kit: Utilized to display received data in historical charts.
4. React-native-svg: Used to enhance the functionality of react-native-chart-kit, allowing additional chart lines and price tooltips when the chart is touched.

Additionally, I used Postman to make CoinGecko API requests and analyze their results.

I am once again convinced that Expo is a great tool for creating React Native applications and for real-time editing.
